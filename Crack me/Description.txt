Solution principle:
1) Dissembling (e.g. with IDA Freeware)
2) Find that the success message is called in the sub_40134D function and the failure 
	message is called in sub_401362 and sub_40137E.
3) We find that sub_40134D is in WinProc, before that two functions are called and the 
	results are compared, and after that there is a success/failback output (loc_4011E6)
4) Ð¡onsider called functions sub_4013D8 and sub_40137E
5) sub_4013D8:
	receives the code as a string, 
	converts it to a number and produces xor 1234h, 
	the answer returns in ebx
6) sub_40137E:
	receives the login as a string (up to 10 letters),
	counts the sum of all letters, and if it meets a character less than A, 
	it immediately fails, but if the character is greater than Z, 
	it subtracts another 20h (as if it is uppercase), 
	above the received sum is xor 5678h and the result is displayed in eax.
7) => to generate a key you need to calculate the sum of letters in the 
	login according to the specified rule, and then produce xor 1234h xor 5678h.
8) Thus the login is valid if its length is less than 10 and there is no symbol up to A in it.
